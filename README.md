# Varone dark UI theme

An Atom theme forked from One Dark UI theme.
This change a few set of features for match darker desktop themes.

There is a matching UI theme [Varone Dark Syntax](https://github.com/fndercole/varone-dark-syntax). For the screenshot I use both matching themes, with Ubuntu mono font.
